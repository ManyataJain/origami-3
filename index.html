        <p>Interesting facts about camels</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camels are very social, even though they might seem extremely laid-back and slow. In the wild, they travel with around 30 others when looking for food.</li>
            <li>A camel might appear to have thick fur, but its coat reflects the sun. This makes it ideal in the hot desert, and the camels don’t get too hot.</li>
            <li>Camels aren’t as slow as they look – they can run up to speeds of 40mph. However, they cannot maintain this for very long, but can comfortably move at up to 25mph.</li>
